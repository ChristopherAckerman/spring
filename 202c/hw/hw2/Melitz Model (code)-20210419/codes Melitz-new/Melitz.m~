%  Chang He
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description: In this file we have some numerical exercises on the
% Melitz model from the Lecture Notes. 
% We start with the basic 2-country model. 
% This script uses the following functions:
% 1) findeq2country:            This function is required to find the 
%                               equilibrium in the 2 country model
% 2) hatalgebra2country:        Hat algebra equations for 2-country model
% 3) modelcalculations2country: Computes additional measures in the model
%                               given wages
